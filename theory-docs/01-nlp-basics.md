# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics

## What is NLP?

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is how computers understand and work with human language. It's like teaching computers to read, understand, and respond to text or speech.

## Key NLP Concepts

### 1. Tokenization

**What it is:** Breaking text into smaller pieces called "tokens"

**Example:**
```
Text: "I love this movie!"
Tokens: ["I", "love", "this", "movie", "!"]
```

This is similar to how `String.split()` works in JavaScript, but more advanced.

### 2. Word Embeddings

**What it is:** Converting words to numbers (vectors) that capture meaning

**How it works:**
- Each word becomes a list of numbers (like [0.2, -0.4, 0.7, ...])
- Similar words have similar numbers
- This helps the computer understand relationships between words

**Example:**
- The vectors for "king" and "queen" would be similar
- The vectors for "happy" and "sad" would be very different

### 3. Text Classification

**What it is:** Sorting text into categories

**Examples:**
- Deciding if an email is spam or not
- Finding out if a movie review is positive or negative
- Identifying which emotion a sentence expresses

### 4. Sequence Models

**What it is:** Models that understand the order of words

**Why it matters:**
- "The dog bit the man" and "The man bit the dog" have the same words but very different meanings
- Sequence models (like LSTM or Transformer) remember what came before

## BERT: A Powerful NLP Model

BERT is a popular NLP model used in this project. Here's what makes it special:

1. **Bidirectional:** It looks at words before AND after the current word
2. **Pre-trained:** It already "knows" a lot about language before we use it
3. **Context-aware:** It understands that words can mean different things in different contexts

**Example:** The word "bank"
- "I went to the bank to deposit money" (financial institution)
- "I sat on the bank of the river" (edge of a river)

BERT can tell the difference based on context.

## How NLP is Used in This Project

In our video sentiment analysis:

1. We extract the text (dialogue) from videos
2. We use BERT to convert this text into number vectors
3. These vectors capture the meaning of what was said
4. This information helps predict the emotion/sentiment

This is just one part of our multimodal approach, which also includes video and audio analysis.
