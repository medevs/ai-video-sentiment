# Sentiment Analysis

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis is how computers figure out the emotional tone in text. It's like teaching a computer to understand if someone is happy, sad, angry, or neutral based on their words.

## Basic Types of Sentiment

Most sentiment analysis systems recognize these basic categories:

1. **Positive** - Happy, excited, pleased
2. **Negative** - Sad, angry, disappointed
3. **Neutral** - Neither positive nor negative

## More Complex Emotions

This project goes beyond basic sentiment and also detects specific emotions:

1. **Anger** - Feeling mad or irritated
2. **Disgust** - Feeling repulsed or disliking something strongly
3. **Fear** - Feeling scared or worried
4. **Joy** - Feeling happy or delighted
5. **Neutral** - No strong emotion
6. **Sadness** - Feeling unhappy or down
7. **Surprise** - Feeling shocked or astonished

## How Sentiment Analysis Works

### 1. Rule-Based Approach (Simple)

This is like using a dictionary of words with emotional scores:
- "Excellent" = +3 (very positive)
- "Good" = +1 (positive)
- "Bad" = -1 (negative)
- "Terrible" = -3 (very negative)

The computer adds up the scores to determine the overall sentiment.

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't understand context
- Misses sarcasm
- Can't handle new words

### 2. Machine Learning Approach (Advanced)

This is what our project uses:

1. **Training:** The model learns from thousands of examples where humans have labeled the sentiment
2. **Features:** The model looks at:
   - Which words are used
   - Word order
   - Grammar patterns
   - Context clues
3. **Classification:** The model makes predictions based on what it learned

### 3. Deep Learning Approach (Most Advanced)

Our project uses deep learning, which:
- Uses neural networks (similar to how human brains work)
- Can understand complex patterns
- Learns from the data without needing specific rules
- Gets better with more examples

## Challenges in Sentiment Analysis

### 1. Sarcasm and Irony

Example: "Oh great, my phone just died. Wonderful timing!"
- The words "great" and "wonderful" are positive
- But the actual sentiment is negative

### 2. Context Matters

Example: "The movie was predictable"
- In a thriller: This is negative
- In a children's movie: This might be positive

### 3. Mixed Sentiments

Example: "The food was delicious but the service was terrible"
- Contains both positive and negative elements

## Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

Our project goes beyond just analyzing text by also looking at:

1. **Facial Expressions** (from video)
   - Smiling, frowning, etc.

2. **Voice Tone** (from audio)
   - Volume, pitch, speed

This gives a more complete understanding of emotion, just like how humans use multiple cues to understand feelings.
